Scenario-based Learning with a Customized AI Chatbot 

Using GPT 3.5, OpenAI, Python, and Panel

This chatbot was tuned with a specific set of instructions in order to generate a realistic scenario. In the scenario, the learner (User) role-plays as a developer who is wondering whether Densify would be an appropriate tool to improve the performance of their application. By employing generative AI, the chatbot can engage in complex, real-world scenarios with unparalleled flexibility, enabling learners to explore and understand the practical implications of applying Densify to improve application performance. 

The AI (CloudOptimizationBot) generates a series of questions to help evaluate the particular use case, and then it formulates a recommendation based on the learner's responses. It also provides a relevant use case and offers to help the learner learn more with a follow-up call. 

This interactive scenario engages the learner as theoretical knowledge is applied in real-time. The learner can deepen their understanding by testing out a variety of hypothetical situations. This method is especially effective in educational and training contexts where engagement and active participation significantly enhance retention and understanding. Developed with Python in a Jupyter notebook, this app uses the OpenAI's GPT 3.5 model and Panel for the chatbot GUI.
